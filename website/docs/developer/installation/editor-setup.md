# Editor Setup

A properly configured editor will improve your productivity with DeviceScript. If this is your first time setting up an editor or youâ€™re looking to tune up your current editor, we have a few recommendations.

## Your editor 

DeviceScript is based on the TypeScript language, so using an editor has good support for it is highly recommended.

VS Code is one of the most popular editors in use today. It has a large marketplace of extensions and integrates well with popular services like GitHub. Most of the features listed below can be added to VS Code as extensions as well, making it highly configurable!

As part of the project initialization (`devsc init`), DeviceScript will create configuration files for linting and formatting your source code in VS Code

There are many other editors, pick the one that works best for you!
